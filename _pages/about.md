# About Me
I am currently a first-year master's student at [PALM](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/home.html) Lab, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University (SEU), under the supervision of Professor [Xu Yang](https://yangxuntu.github.io/). Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in School of Mathematics at the same institution. My research interests primarily focus on parallel inference in Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on speculative decoding methods, as well as the reasoning ability of LLMs.
